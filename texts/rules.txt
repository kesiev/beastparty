Both players start with the same 10 cards deck and 50 influence points. Shuffle all decks. A turn starts picking 5 cards from your deck (if empty, replace it with your shuffled discard pile) and filling the market to 5 cards using the 50 cards market deck. You can play any number of cards from your hand in front of you and 1. CHARM: move one card from the market to your discard pile if the sum of played CP is equal or greater the card CC or 2. MUTE: move one card from the opponent party to his discard pile and pick a new card from your deck if the sum of played MP is equal or greater the opponent card LP. All your played cards are discarded after every action. The turn ends when you play your last card from your hand: the remaining played cards are your party. Reduce your influence points by the sum of the opponent party LP and if hits 0, you lose! Your opponent discards his party and starts his turn. Keep playing until there's a winner. Good luck!

//
// RULES:
//
// Both players start with the same 10 cards deck and 50 influence points. Shuffle
// all decks. A turn starts picking 5 cards from your deck (if empty, replace it
// with your shuffled discard pile) and filling the market to 5 cards using the 50
// cards market deck. You can play any number of cards from your hand in front of
// you and 1. CHARM: move one card from the market to your discard pile if the sum
// of played CP is equal or greater the card CC or 2. MUTE: move one card from the
// opponent party to his discard pile and pick a new card from your deck if the
// sum of played MP is equal or greater the opponent card LP. All your played cards
// are discarded after every action. The turn ends when you play your last card
// from your hand: the remaining played cards are your party. Reduce your influence
// points by the sum of the opponent party LP and if hits 0, you lose! Your opponent
// discards his party and starts his turn. Keep playing until there's a winner
// Good luck!
